Ans. Flexbox is used for layout along a single-axis whether rows or columns while CSS Grid Layout is used when you want to lay the elements along both row and column axis.
Flexbox is used to control simple layouts whereas Grid  is used for Complex 2-D layouts.
CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are both powerful layout systems in CSS, and they each have their own strengths and use cases. Here's a general guideline on when to use each:

Flexbox is most fitting for creating straightforward, one-dimensional layouts. Flexbox is better for one-dimensional or single-line layouts where you just need to space a bunch of elements a certain way. Use Flexbox when you aren’t as worried about the layout and just want everything to fit⁵.

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that lets you work along two axes: horizontally and vertically. Grid is best for two-dimensional layouts with many elements that need to be precisely positioned relative to each other. Grid is optimal for producing intricate, two-dimensional layouts. Use Grid when you already have the layout structure in mind⁵.
